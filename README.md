#Lucky Number

This Android app injects a touch of fun and lightheartedness into your day by generating a personalized lucky number based on user input.

For the UI part I have used figma for all the the drawable resources
I have used the random module of Java for the algorithm, you can also share the result with your friends.
For the sharing function, I created a method and used Intent class for it.
